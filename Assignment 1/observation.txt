1.If we can decide the sequence of functions executed fron 'gprof'
->No,we can't decide the sequence of functions executed from 'gprof'

2.Complexity of the Algorithm
->Best Case(when the pivot element is middle or near to middle element):O(n*logn)
->Average Case(when array elements are in jumbled order):O(n*logn)
->Worst case(when pivot element is either greatest or smallest):O(n^2)
